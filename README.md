# Smart Parking System Simulation

## Project Overview
The **Smart Parking System Simulation** is designed to mimic the operations of a real-world parking system. This project aims to simulate various aspects of managing parking spots, including the allocation, tracking, and checkout of vehicles in a parking lot. It is developed using Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) concepts to provide a structured and efficient solution.

## Key Features
- **Vehicle Registration:** 
  - Register vehicles with details like license plate number and vehicle type.
- **Parking Spot Allocation:**
  - Assign available parking spots to incoming vehicles.
- **Real-Time Tracking:**
  - Monitor the occupancy status of each parking spot.
- **Vehicle Checkout:**
  - List vehicles currently parked and facilitate their checkout process.
- **Vehicle Types:**
  - Handle different vehicle types (e.g., car, bike, truck) with appropriate parking spot allocation.

## Technologies Used
- **Programming Language:** C++
- **Development Environment:** Visual Studio Code

## OOP Concepts Applied
- **Classes and Objects:**
  - Implemented classes such as `Vehicle` and `ParkingSpot` to encapsulate related data and methods.
- **Encapsulation and Abstraction:**
  - Encapsulated vehicle and parking spot details, providing interfaces for interaction.
- **Inheritance and Polymorphism:**
  - Future implementation may involve vehicle subclasses (e.g., `Car`, `Bike`) with specific attributes.
- **This Pointer:**
  - Utilized within class methods to reference the current object instance.

## Progress
The project is currently in its initial phase, with basic classes for `Vehicle` and `ParkingSpot` implemented. Further features, such as spot allocation and checkout, will be developed incrementally.
